YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

So basically, it costs money to run Unity Teams. 
And GitHub is free as long as your program is open source.

Therefore, THIS is what we're gonna do.

1. Navigate to https://git-scm.com/ and download the version for Windows.
2. Install the program, you might need the tech guy to install it on ur laptops.
3. oh shoot i forgot that you can't right click in the schools laptops on student accounts.
4. ok so we might need to make local admin accounts on our computers because we can't use git bash without right click
5. if yall are cool w that i can probably figure out how to put local admin accounts on yall's computers like on mine

ONCE THIS IS ALL DONE: open the "how to push changes to github.txt" to learn how to use git.
