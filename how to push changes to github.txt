notes for using git:

1. right click in the "magicdonut" folder and click "Open Git Bash here"

2. when finished working type in 
	- git add .
	
		- This will make git track the changes you made in the folder
		
	- git commit -m "<add your comment here>"
	
		- YOU MUST DO THIS BEFORE PUSHING
		- This command adds a comment to the commit you are going to push
		- in the "", add your comment.
		- it can be multiline, for example
			 git commit -m "text text text
			 test test"
		
		- just make sure you close your quotations
		
	- git push -u origin
	
		- this pushes your commit and any changes you made to the repository in github
		
		
3. So in order, it should look like this
	git add .
	git commit -m "comment"
	git push -u origin
